# Aim -
To learn about for loop and while loop.

## Software Used -
VS Code

## Problem Statement -
1.) Write a c++ code for printing numbers using for loop.

2.) Write a c++ code for printing numbers using while loop.

3.) Write a c++ code for making a triangular star pattern.

4.) Write a c++ code for making a square shaped star pattern.

5.) Write a c++ code for making a pyramid of star.

6.) Write a c++ code to get sum of the numbers printed.

7.) Write a c++ code to make a Floyd triangle.

8.) Write a c++ code to make Floyd triangle of alphabets.

9.) Write a c++ code for password validation till correct password is entered.

## Theory -
Loops are used to make the program less repetitive and compact ny iterating a part of a program several times .Thus,they are also  called repetitive control structures.

Types of loops:-

a) *For Loop*

b) *While Loop*

### A) For Loop -
 A "for" loop is a control flow statement used to repeat a block of code a certain number of times.
 
 for loop in C++ allows you to repeat a block of code a specific number of times.
 
 The syntax can vary slightly depending on the programming language. 
 
 Its syntax is:

```
for (initialization; condition; update) {
    // Code to execute
}
```


### Example:

```
for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
    std::cout << i << std::endl;
}
```

This loop prints numbers 0 to 4.

 ### B) While loop:-
 A "while" loop is another type of control flow statement that repeatedly executes a block of code as long as a specified condition is true. 

  You can control the flow inside a "while" loop using break to exit the loop and continue to skip to the next iteration.
  
  A while loop in C++ repeats a block of code as long as a specified condition is true. 
  
  syntax :

```
while (condition) {
    // Code to execute
}
```

### Example:

```
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    int i = 0;
    while (i < 5) {
        std::cout << i << std::endl;
        i++;
    }
    return 0;
}
```
